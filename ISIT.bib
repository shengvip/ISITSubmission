This paper offers a method that detects articulatory compensation in the acoustic signal, which is based on linear regression modeling of co-variation patterns between acoustic cues. We demonstrate the method on selected acoustic cues for spontaneously produced American English stop consonants. Compensatory patterns of cue variation were observed for voiced stops in some cue pairs, while uniform patterns of cue variation were found for stops as a function of place of articulation or position in the word. Overall, the results suggest that this method can be useful for observing articulatory strategies indirectly from acoustic data and testing hypotheses about the conditions under which articulatory compensation is most likely."

abstract={To develop speaker adaptation algorithms for deep neural network (DNN) that are suitable for large-scale online deployment, it is desirable that the adaptation model be represented in a compact form and learned in an unsupervised fashion. In this paper, we propose a novel low-footprint adaptation technique for DNN that adapts the DNN model through node activation functions. The approach introduces slope and bias parameters in the sigmoid activation functions for each speaker, allowing the adaptation model to be stored in a small-sized storage space. We show that this adaptation technique can be formulated in a linear regression fashion, analogous to other speak adaptation algorithms that apply additional linear transformations to the DNN layers. We further investigate semi-supervised online adaptation by making use of the user click-through data as a supervision signal. The proposed method is evaluated on short message dictation and voice search tasks in supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised setups. Compared with the singular value decomposition (SVD) bottleneck adaptation, the proposed adaptation method achieves comparable accuracy improvements with much smaller footprint.},

However, achieving satisfactory accuracy in personalized music emotion recognition for a user is difficult because it requires an impractically huge amount of annotations from the user. In this paper, we adopt a probabilistic framework for valence-arousal music emotion modeling and propose an adaptation method based on linear regression to personalize a background model in an online learning fashion. We also incorporate a component-tying strategy to enhance the model flexibility. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to test the performance of the proposed method on three datasets, including a new one created specifically in this work for personalized music emotion recognition.
