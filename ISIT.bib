The system includes a transfer function converting circuit for converting transfer functions between a listener and the first and second speakers into different transfer functions in different directions from those to the first and second speakers, a delay circuit for compensating for a distant difference between the listener and the first and second speakers, and a reverberation circuit for providing reverberation to two channel input signals, whereby a feeling of a widened sound region is obtained even in a small passenger compartment.}

  abstract={A vehicle audio system includes overhead speakers connected to an audio source through a control circuit. The control circuit effects signal delays, crossover filtering, and equalization. The overhead speakers are connected to the control circuit and are positioned such that they provide strong front staging and desired surrounding ambiance responsive to the output signals of the control circuit. According to one aspect of the invention, the speakers are mounted directly to the headliner.}

An interface unit receives and translates vehicle audio system control signals and forwards the translated signals in a form interpretable by the personal digital media device for execution. The interface unit may also receive responses from the personal digital media device and forward translated responses to the vehicle audio system for, for example, display in the vehicle audio system's display device. In response to predetermined control signals from the vehicle audio system, the interface unit may command the personal digital media device to playback user-defined playlists named in accordance with a playlist naming convention. The vehicle operator is thus provided an intuitive way to control the personal digital media device remotely via the vehicle audio system's controls, including via steering wheel-mounted audio system controls.

Also displayed on the touch-screen is a touch sensitive balance slide controller and a touch sensitive fade slide controller. As the user makes left-right balance selections on the balance controller, and front-rear fader selections on the fade controller, an acoustic sweet spot designator is presented on the displayed representation of the passenger cabin. The acoustic sweet spot designator, which corresponds to the pre-determined acoustic sweet spot, is based on the combination of the current left-right balance and front-rear fader settings.
