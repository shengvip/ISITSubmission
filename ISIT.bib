  abstract                 = {A sound reproduction system for a motor vehicle in which two channel signals are applied to two loudspeakers provided in the passenger compartment to reproduce the signals. The system includes a transfer function converting circuit for converting transfer functions between a listener and the first and second speakers into different transfer functions in different directions from those to the first and second speakers, a delay circuit for compensating for a distant difference between the listener and the first and second speakers, and a reverberation circuit for providing reverberation to two channel input signals, whereby a feeling of a widened sound region is obtained even in a small passenger compartment.}
